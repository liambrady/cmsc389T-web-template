# cmsc388T-web-template

Apart from the required changes that I made to the website (referencing some
project descriptions that I have previously written) the main personalization
of the website was the adoption of a new color scheme. This color scheme
revolves around the color #9484e3, which is a subtle purple color that I
like. In addition to this, however, I also made small edits to the size of
the project description background boxes to fit the large amount of text
included to describe some of the projects I have previously worked on. All of
this occured primarily within the CSS of the webpage.
